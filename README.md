One of the repositories I am interested in is [SYZOJ](https://github.com/syzoj/syzoj) by Menci. SYZOJ is an online judge, which you can create computer programming problems and contests, submit your code, and it can check the correctness of your code. One of the most famous online judge in China, [Libre Oj](https://loj.ac/), is powered by SYZOJ. Once I used this template to build my own online judge on Ubuntu 18.04 on VMware WorkStation Pro for fun.
